    In Titanfall, players control "Pilots" and their mech-style Titans, and fight in six-on-six matches set in the
    war-torn outer space colonies of the Frontier. The game is optimized for fast-paced, continual action, aided by
    wall-running abilities and populations of computer-controlled soldiers. Other titles in the series includes unique
    characters who are able to use special abilities.
